Its ensemble nature also makes it powerful in capturing complex patterns and interactions in the data."

## 30. What Would You Do If Your Model is Performing Well on Training Data but Poorly on Test Data?
"If my model performs well on training data but poorly on test data, it indicates overfitting. To address this, I would:

Cross-Validation: Use cross-validation techniques like k-fold to better evaluate the modelâ€™s performance.
Regularization: Apply regularization methods like L1 (Lasso) or L2 (Ridge) to reduce complexity.
Feature Selection: Simplify the model by removing irrelevant or redundant features.
Data Augmentation: Increase the amount of training data through augmentation techniques if applicable.
Ensemble Methods: Use ensemble techniques like bagging or boosting to improve generalization. These steps help improve the modelâ€™s performance on unseen data, making it more robust and reliable."
